You can simply unzip and run the "ControlStation.exe" under release-builds if you are running windows or build it for a different platform as described below. I zipped the exe because of the 100 MB limit imposed by github.

Alternatively, if you have npm installed, you can run the program with

$npm install
$npm start

Within the project directory.

<h3>Packaging for different platforms </h3>

$npm run package-<platform>

Where platform is "win", "mac", or "linux".
